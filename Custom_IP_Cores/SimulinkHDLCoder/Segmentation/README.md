# Image/Frame Segmentation using Online K-Means Algorithm

* The Simulink model generates HDL files for K-means clustering IP core with AXI4 streaming interface.

* Two versions are provided: K=4 and K=8

* A pre-built bit file for testing on Zedboard SOC is avaialable in the Vivado project folder in the same repository

* Please cite this work as follows

INFO: [ProjectBase 1-489] The host OS only allows 260 characters in a normal path. The project is stored in a path with more than 80 characters. If you experience issues with IP, Block Designs, or files not being found, please consider moving the project to a location with a shorter path. Alternately consider using the OS subst command to map part of the path to a drive letter.
Current project path is 'D:/Work/XilFPGAdev/Custom_IP_Cores/SimulinkHDLCoder/SGBMDisparity/hdl_prj/ipcore/SGBMHDLAl_ip_v1_0/prj_ip'
CRITICAL WARNING: [Vivado 12-3645] Please note that adding or importing multiple files, one at a time, can be performance intensive.  Both add_files and import_files commands accept multiple files as input, and passing a collection of multiple files to a single add_files or import_files commands can offer significant performance improvement.
